## Stack in C language

For a perfect understanding of this project it is necessary to have some prior knowledge of the simple linked list. In my profile there is a repository that covers this subject.

The program is developed in the C programming language.

The project consists of a data structure that stores data in LIFO (Last In First Out) order. In other words, the last element to enter the chain is the first to leave when it is removed. For this, only one pointer is needed to control the entry and exit of elements.
For the current project, it should be based on the idea that no repeated numbers will be inserted.

Run the program preferably in visual studio code. Running it in the Clion compiler I found some unexplained bugs.
